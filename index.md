### Sample Code as of now to use in future for discussions or challenges 

```js
// Sample avascript code with syntax highlighting for future use .
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Sample Ruby code with syntax highlighting for future use.
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

###### Table format kept to manage filling details in future

| heading1     | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |

| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
